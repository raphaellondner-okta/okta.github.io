excerpt: The next evolution of the OAuth protocol focusing on client developer simplicity

OAuth 2.0 is the next evolution of the OAuth protocol and is not backwards compatible with OAuth 1.0. OAuth 2.0 focuses on client developer simplicity while providing specific authorization flows for web applications, desktop applications, mobile phones, and living room devices. The specification and associated RFCs are developed by the IETF OAuth WG;[5] the main framework was published in October 2012. (It was expected to be finalized by the end of 2010, according to Eran Hammer.[6] However, due to discordant views about the evolution of OAuth, Hammer left the working group.[7])

Facebook's Graph API only supports OAuth 2.0.[8] Google supports OAuth 2.0 as the recommended authentication mechanism for all of its APIs.[9] As of 2011 Microsoft[10] has added OAuth 2.0 experimental support to their APIs.

The OAuth 2.0 Framework[11] and Bearer Token Usage[12] were published in October 2012. Other documents are still being worked on within the OAuth working group.
