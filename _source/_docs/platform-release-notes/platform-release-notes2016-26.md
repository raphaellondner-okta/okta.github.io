## New Feature: API for Custom SMS Template
    
You can send custom text as part of an SMS message request:

1. Use the `/api/v1/templates/sms` endpoint to create a custom SMS text template.Â 
2. Send a request to the Factors API specifying the template for verification. There is no change in the response.

For more information, see [Templates API](http://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/templates.html) and [Factors API](http://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/factors.html).

## Feature Enhancement: Resource Owner Password Credential Flow for OpenID Connect Supports Refresh Tokens

The `/oauth2/v1/token` endpoint includes a Refresh Token if:
 
* The request contains a `grant_type` with the value `password` and your client supports the `grant_type` value `refresh_token`. For more information, see [Token Request](http://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/oauth2.html#request-parameters-1).
* You request the `offline_access` scope. For more information, see [Refresh Tokens for Web and Native Applications](http://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/oauth2.html#refresh-tokens-for-web-and-native-applications).

## Bugs Fixed

The following issue is fixed:
 
* For some customers, an API request for users that match a value for `last_name` didn't return all the matches. (OKTA-91367)
